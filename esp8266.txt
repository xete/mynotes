esp8266-01 8pinouts:
  ------------
  RX       VCC
  GPIO0    RST 
  GPIO2  CH_PD
  GND       TX
  ------------
VCC CH_PD -- 3.3V(recommended)
             or higher to 5V if the supply is not enough
GND -- reference ground
RST -- pull up to VCC through a 3K-10K resistor
GPIO0 -- mode seletion pin
         MUST leave it floating while booting to enter normal boot,
		 pull down to GND through a 330-500Ohm resistor or directly
         to enter programming mode
GPIO2 -- just as normal io pin
RX TX -- serial ports

NEVER flash esp8266 while the serial is monitoring, otherwise it fails.
NOTE THAT some newer sdk version COULD NOT fit earlier chips.
